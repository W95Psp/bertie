Bertie is a minimal, high-assurance implementation of TLS 1.3 written in subset of Rust called [hacspec](https://github.com/hacspec/hacspec).

It follows design principles:

1) It is purely functional: it has no mutable data structures or externally visible side-effects
2) It is verification friendly: it is written in hacspec and translates to F*
3) It is succinct and minimal: it is configured with a single protocol version and ciphersuite

Bertie was first authored by Karthikeyan Bhargavan at Inria in 2021 and subsequently transferred to Cryspen in 2022.
It is licensed under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE) but is not yet ready for public consumption.

**USING BERTIE**

An example application using Bertie is provided in the `simple_https_client` crate that implements an HTTPS client that
connects to and retrieves a web page using Bertie as the underlying TLS implementation.

You can try out this client by executing in `simple_https_client`:
```
cargo run example.com
```

*WARNING*: This is an early draft of Bertie and strictly work-in-progress. Do not use in production.
